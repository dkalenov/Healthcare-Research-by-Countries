# Healthcare Research by Countries

## Project objectives

Clustering of countries by healthcare costs as a percentage of GDP and life expectancy.

## Tasks
- Data Preparocessing;
- Data Analysis;
- Cluster countries into n-groups;
- Construct graphs based on the clustering results;
- Interpret the result (describe the resulting groups).

## Conclusion

Based on the indicators "health" (healthcare costs as a percentage of GDP) and "life_expec" (life expectancy), it was decided to divide the data into the following 5 groups:

- Group of countries with below-average healthcare costs and below-average life expectancy: This group will include countries where the healthcare system is not very developed and where life expectancy remains low.

- Group of countries with below-average healthcare costs and near or above-average life expectancy: This group will include countries where healthcare is organized effectively despite low healthcare costs, and where life expectancy remains high.

- Group of countries with above-average healthcare spending but below-average life expectancy: This group will include countries that spend significant amounts of money on healthcare but, for various reasons, have low life expectancy levels.

- Group of countries with above average healthcare costs and near or above average life expectancy: This group will include countries that devote a significant portion of their GDP to healthcare and have high life expectancy.

- Group of countries with near-average healthcare costs and near or above-average life expectancy: This group will include countries that devote a sufficient portion of their GDP to healthcare and have high life expectancy.
